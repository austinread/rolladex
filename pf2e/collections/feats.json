If you pass on, you get a few minutes to say your goodbyes, and then move into the River of Souls and the afterlife. Your character ceases to be. If you fight the change, you remain, though you and the GM might determine a new unfinished business. If you are physically destroyed, you cease your existence as a ghost but still might not be able to pass on to the afterlife if your unfinished business is incomplete.

First, choose whether you have a power driver dynamo, which deals [[/r {1d6}[bludgeoning]]]{1d6 bludgeoning damage} and has the shove trait, or a percussive striker dynamo, which deals [[/r {1d4}[bludgeoning]]]{1d4 bludgeoning damage} and has the agile and finesse traits. Most dynamos are automated, so they don't require a free hand to use, like other unarmed attacks. However, you can instead choose to make your dynamo be manually controlled via a handheld switch, lever, or other device; to make an attack with a manually controlled dynamo, you must have a hand free to operate it, but the benefit is great control and a more devastating strike. This increases the damage die by one size, to a 1d8 for a power drive dynamo or 1d6 for a percussive striker dynamo. Arm dynamos are always manual, but they use the hand on that arm to operate the dynamo when making strikes. Manual control is required only in the heat of combat, not for less strenuous adventuring or everyday activities.</p>\n<p>You need to keep your sterling dynamo wound, but the process isn't particularly onerous, so in most situations, it won't be an issue. If you spend 1 minute winding up your dynamo, it can remain active for 24 hours before needing additional winding. However, enemies can attempt to Disable the dynamo, which has a level equal to your own, to reduce the remaining operational time by 1 hour, or 2 hours on a critical success. Certain other abilities that adversely affect technology might also reduce the dynamo's remaining operational time. When your dynamo is out of operational time, you can still use it as a normal prosthetic, but you cannot use your dynamo unarmed attack or any other abilities from this archetype until you wind the dynamo again. You can wind the dynamo for 1 minute at any time to return it to the maximum 24 hours of operational time.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.6KciIDJV6ZdJcAVa]{Sterling Dynamo} archetype.</p>", "featType": "archetype", "level": 2, "prerequisites": [], "source": "Pathfinder Guns & Gears", "traits": {"custom": "", "rarity": "uncommon", "value": ["archetype", "dedication"]}}, {"name": "Sticky Bomb", "actionType": "free", "description": "<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You use @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Quick Alchemy]{Quick Alchemy} to craft an alchemical bomb, and that bomb's level is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You mix in an additive to make your bomb's contents adhere to the target and continue to deal damage.</p>\n<p>A creature that takes a direct hit from one of your sticky bombs also takes persistent damage equal to and of the same type as the bomb's splash damage.
